# CollagePlus for ProcessWire

[CollagePlus](http://ed-lea.github.io/jquery-collagePlus/) is a jQuery plugin
by [Ed Lea](http://ed-lea.github.io/jquery-collagePlus/). It takes a list of 
images and converts it to a nicely formatted grid. With this module, we use 
the CollagePlus plugin to produce nice grid output for ProcessWire image 
selection. This applies to the images that you select when clicking the image
icon from the rich text editor (TinyMCE or CKEditor). 

The idea for this is from the great [Unify admin theme](http://mods.pw/4p)
for ProcessWire by [adamspruijt](http://modules.processwire.com/authors/adamspruijt/).

To use, simply install the module and it is ready to go.

## Requirements

This module should run on any version of ProcessWire. But to be on the safe side,
it would be best to use version 2.2 or newer. If you are using version 2.3.1 or newer
this module makes use of conditional autoload for increased efficiency.
