# SelectorTest Process Module

This module creates a page in the ProcessWire admin where you can test and build
selectors without editing a template file or a bootstrapped script.

## Features

* Edit selector string and display results (and possible errors as reported by ProcessWire)
* Explore properties and data of matching pages in a tree view
  * Language aware: multi-language and language-alternate fields supported
  * Repeater fields and values
  * Images and their variations on disk
  * More data is loaded on-demand as the tree is traversed deeper
* Quick links to edit/view pages, edit templates and run new selectors (select pages with the same template or children of a page)
* Page statuses visualized like in default admin theme
* Add pagination
